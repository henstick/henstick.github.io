                        <h2 class="text-white mb-4">Threats</h2>
                        <p class="text-white-50">Threats represent negative and external factors that an organization can’t control. These include factors that may disrupt the future of the company or current strategies. The impact of these threats on a business must be assessed and anticipated to take action against them before they negatively impact the company. As a geographically localized venture, Nubank entering a new country and specifically one that is culturally, economically, and politically so differentiated, there are several key risks that must be taken into consideration when analyzing the future of the company into the new market.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Nubank is largely successful in Latin and South American countries, over half of the Brazilian population banking with Nubank. When entering a Southeast Asian country such as Indonesia three key threats jump out. Competition from other neobanks, regulatory guidelines, and a lack of physical infrastructure.</p>

<p class="text-white-50"><strong>Competition:</strong></p>

<p class="text-white-50">Neobanking in Indonesia is relatively well-known with a few major players in the industry. The availability of digital banking and being able to open an account on your mobile device is quite attractive to the generally young population. Key competitors include Finture, GoPay, Digibank, TMRW, and Jenius. These neobanks offer extremely user friendly interfaces and employ AI tools to include budget analytics and track customer spending. They are all competitive within the industry, offering 24/7/365 assistance and “hyper personalised” services. These banks have established themselves with network providers such as MasterCard, Visa, GPN, etc., to provide more seamless transactions and experiences for their customers.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Indonesia is one of the leaders in the fintech space within Southeast Asia, having a relatively young population who have access to technology and are willing to switch to nontraditional banking services. Entering an environment of such a nature poses a large threat to Nubank as they try to establish their customer base and penetrate a portion of the market. About 51% of the Indonesian market is underbanked and about 55% of non digital customers are willing to shift to neobanking within the next six months. (“Neo Banking in Indonesia,” Twimbit, n.d.) Leveraging this growth is key for Nubank to be successful.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">With a significant portion of the underbanked population being quite rural, Nubank could find success in partnering with smaller traditional banks and startups in rural areas to appeal to an underserved market. The product differentiation within current competitors is quite high as well, though there are several products that are currently unavailable in several of the major players, including lending and business management tools advisory. Implementation of marketing strategies such as zero-fee accounts for a certain period of time or low interest lending offers distinctiveness for Nubank, differentiating themselves from current competitors. Exploitation of these underserved products and rural areas are strong strategies Nubank can implement to penetrate the market and begin to compete with the already established neobanks.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">As previously shown, Nubank’s efforts in new Latin American markets like Mexico and Colombia and their ability to capture market share in a short period of time emphasizes their ability to penetrate a market currently dominated by other comparable neobanks and succeed.</p>

<p class="text-white-50"><strong>Regulatory Guidelines:</strong></p>

<p class="text-white-50">Nubank’s current presence in Brazil and other Latin American markets establishes their ability to work with regulatory authorities and guidelines in several countries. When entering a market such as Indonesia, there are very different rules and regulations for banking and specifically fintech. Having to comply with such regulations that may be quite different from current operations could pose a large threat to the success of Nubank in Indonesia. Neobanking services can be provided directly through banks and financial institutions. These digital banks must secure a business license and adhere to specific conditions including institutional, finance, risk management, and information system capability requirements.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Specific potential threats for Nubank include limitations on foreign ownership and control of payment service providers (PSPs). These PSPs are required to have a minimum of 15% Indonesian shareholding, with 51% voting rights held by Indonesian investors in non-bank PSPs. The Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Indonesia’s financial services regulator, established a legal framework in 2018 to govern neobanking services.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">When Nubank enters Indonesia, there would be several requirements for the business to establish themselves. They would need to establish themselves as a legal entity and secure a business license from the OJK, meeting the regulations on structure, capitalization, finance, and risk management. They would need to abide by the 15% shareholding and 51% voting rights. (McKinsey & Company 2022) They also might be required to participate in a regulatory sandbox, a controlled testing environment that allows fintech firms and startups to experiment with new products, services, or business models under regulatory supervision, to assess the reliability of their business model.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Regulatory guidelines are typically the most difficult to work around because they are strict and usually stagnant. Nubank is quite well established and has had success entering other markets. With their breadth of resources and capital, working through these hurdles will most likely be fully achievable.</p>

<p class="text-white-50"><strong>Lack of Physical Presence:</strong></p>

<p class="text-white-50">As the concept of the neobank suggests, Nubank lacks any physical locations excluding headquarters and regional offices. Nubank has found much success due to this natural aspect of the business, keeping overhead costs extremely low and thus being able to offer competitive rates. This lack of a physical presence highlights the key risks of entering the country and establishing a customer base due to the unique culture of the nation as well as the inherent differences between Indonesia and the current climate of Latin American countries.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Indonesia remains a largely cash-based society, especially in rural areas where many people store their money as cash rather than in bank accounts. This cultural preference makes a purely digital banking approach difficult. These rural areas also have challenges in terms of internet connectivity and digital infrastructure. Because a majority of the underbanked population resides in rural areas, there tends to be a general distrust of digital banking and digital services. (InnReg 2023) The collectivism of distrust bleeds through the rural areas and makes penetration challenging.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">Adapting to Indonesian culture is one of the most important considerations Nubank should have. Gradual digitization should be a main focus, as Nubank may want to target more rural areas to gain a portion of the underbanked population not currently obtained by its competitors, a lack of financial literacy and resources is a major inhibiting factor. Investing in financial literacy programs to educate consumers about digital banking benefits and to build trust within the smaller communities in non-traditional banking methods. Strategic partnerships with established local entities will also provide physical access points for these communities to engage with Nubank. Gradually introducing these methods to the more rural areas as well as implementing Nubank’s more traditional services in developed cities, Nubank can look to transition customers from cash to digital banking, rather than pushing for an immediate shift that would most likely not be well-received.</p>

<p class="text-white-50">This digital transformation should be aware of sensitivities regarding Indonesia’s dominant Islamic culture. This could include features that support Islamic banking principles such as digital tools for zakat calculations. Training chatbots in Indonesian language nuances and cultural norms. Tailoring Nubank’s offerings to meet the specific needs of Indonesian consumers, such as providing financial literacy programs to underserved rural areas and creating seamless integrations of digital banking services with current technologies.</p>

<p class="text-white-50"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p class="text-white-50">Entering any new market, specifically one that is so culturally different from the current market served by Nubank will come with its fair share of challenges. Identifying these threats and assessing the overall risk of the threat to the success of Nubank within Indonesia is key to the implementation of the company in the nation. Identifying the competition, regulatory challenges, and the impact of the lack of a physical presence allows for Nubank to mitigate these threats and create new opportunities in the rural regions that are currently underbanked and underserved. This creates a customer base and a springboard for the company to enter into larger cities and develop their differentiated product offerings to secure a significant portion of the market share.</p>
